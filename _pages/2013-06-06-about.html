<p><span class="titlefont">Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur</span> is a space for frank exploration of relationships, sexuality, and some of the finer points of personal interaction within the furry fandom. It is intended to be a safe space for authors to write about the ways in which these topics interact on social, cultural, and personal levels, helping us to leave no stone unturned in our explorations.</p>
<p>The intersection between our subculture, sexuality, and love is complex, and all the more interesting for that fact. A lot of what motivates us in life is the pursuit of happiness in all its varied forms, and the fact that we are so varied is what helps make all of this so interesting: things don’t always line up, or they line up beautifully, and the reasons for that are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Furry does not take place in a social vacuum, of course, but it does act as an attractor in a chaotic system: those of us who get close tend to stay close and find happiness within this system that is bound up in our happiness. We have a tendency to date within the fandom, to fall in love with other furries, and to enjoy our time together, always seeming to steer down the same path. It’s hardly a new phenomenon, but it's very much pertinent.</p>
<p><span class="titlefont">Love ◦ Sex ◦ Fur</span> is an <a href="http://adjectivespecies.com" target="_blank">[adjective][species]</a> project.</p>
<h2>Comment Protocol</h2>
<p>Discussion is more than welcomed on LSF, it's very much encouraged!  However, in order to maintain the site as a safe space for both authors and readers, comments are moderated by default on all posts.  While it's up to the author or an admin to approve comments (we get emails, don't worry!), the general rule of thumb is that agreeing, disagreeing, discussing, and trying to prove a point are all, of course, fine, but yelling, being excessively crass, and especially shaming are a no-go.  Being crass is the tough part, as this is a site about sex after all, and one should feel free to comment about it as well; just keep in mind it's not an RP site, nor a place to share your encounters/conquests/etc. unless they serve to prove your point.</p>
<p>Be nice and have fun, is all!</p>
