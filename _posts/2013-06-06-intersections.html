<p>Love &#x25e6; Sex &#x25e6; Fur is a new project by [adjective][species] to explore relationships, sexuality, and some of the finer points of personal interaction within the furry fandom.  It is intended to be a safe space for authors to write about the ways in which these topics interact on social, cultural, and personal levels, helping us to leave no stone unturned in our explorations.</p>
<p>The intersection between our subculture, sexuality, and love is complex, and all the more interesting for that fact.  A lot of what motivates us in life is the pursuit of happiness in all its varied forms, and the fact that we are so varied is what helps make all of this so interesting: things don't always line up, or they line up beautifully, and the reasons for that are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Furry does not take place in a social vacuum, of course, but it does act as an attractor in a chaotic system: those of us who get close tend to stay close and find happiness within this system that is bound up in our happiness.  We have a tendency to date within the fandom, to fall in love with other furries, and to enjoy our time together, always seeming to steer down the same path.  It's hardly a new phenomenon, either, but it's still very pertinent.</p>
<p>These are the types of things that LSF will attempt to explore.  The safe space bit of it helps to encourage authors to write what they want to write about with the understanding that that is what the site is all about.  So, with that said, come and join us for exploration of the intersection of love, sex, and fur.</p>
